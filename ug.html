       I am thrilled to share my graduation story from St. Xavier's College (Autonomous), Palayamkottai, 
       where I completed my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Mathematics under Manonmaniam 
       Sundaranar University, Tirunelveli.
       </p>
       <p class="ug">
       My journey at St. Xavier's College was filled with academic challenges, personal growth, and 
       unforgettable memories. As an active participant in the Fine Arts Association, I had the opportunity 
       to pursue my greatest interest in dancing. The college's vibrant cultural scene and supportive 
       environment allowed me to explore my passion while balancing my studies.
      </p>
      <p class="ug">
       Academically, I dedicated myself to my coursework and achieved a commendable score of 82% in my 
       degree. The rigorous curriculum and dedicated faculty at St. Xavier's College equipped me with a 
       strong foundation in Mathematics, preparing me for future endeavors.
     </p>
     <p class="ug">
       As I look back on my time at St. Xavier's College, 
       I am filled with a sense of pride and accomplishment. 
       The lessons I learned, both inside and outside the classroom, have shaped me into the person I am today.
        I am confident that the knowledge and skills I gained will serve me well as I embark on the 
        next chapter of my life.
       </p>
       <p class="ug">
       I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the faculty, staff, and my fellow students 
       who made my undergraduate experience truly unforgettable. 
       St. Xavier's College will always hold a special place in my heart, and 
       I look forward to seeing how the institution continues to shape the lives of future generations.
